# NI Multisim 14 for Linux

> Automated installer script to run **NI Multisim 14.0** on Linux via Wine.

---

## 📋 Description

This project provides a bash script that automates the installation of **National Instruments Multisim 14.0** on Linux, using Wine with a dedicated 32-bit prefix.

The script handles:
- Detection of the Linux distribution
- Removal of conflicting Wine packages
- Installation of Wine and Winetricks (per-distro)
- Creation of a clean 32-bit Wine prefix (`~/.multisim32`)
- Download and extraction of the official Multisim 14.0 installer from NI servers
- Running the installer via Wine
- Automatic download and execution of the **NI License Activator**
- Fixing the `.desktop` launcher (on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora)

- At least **~5 GB** of free disk space

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreaLestingi/NI-Multisim-14-for-Linux.git
cd NI-Multisim-14-for-Linux
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts. At the end, a reboot is recommended.

---

## 📦 What Gets Installed

- **Wine** (stable, 32-bit prefix at `~/.multisim32`)
- **Winetricks** with `corefonts`, `mdac27`, `jet40`
- **NI Multisim 14.0** inside the Wine prefix
- **NI License Activator** (automatically downloaded and executed)

---

## 🔑 License Activation

The script automatically downloads the **NI License Activator** from:

```
https://github.com/AndreaLestingi/NI-Multisim-Crack-1.14/releases/download/activator/NI.License.Activator.exe
```

When the activator window appears:

1. You will see a list of NI products (Multisim, LabVIEW, etc.)
2. Right-click on each product entry
3. Select "Activate" from the context menu
4. Close the activator window when done
    
> **Note:** The activator is provided for educational purposes only. Users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and NI's licensing terms.

## 🗒️ Notes

- On **Arch Linux**, you can choose between installing Wine via Chaotic AUR (faster, prebuilt) or compiling from the AUR.
- On **Fedora**, enabling RPM Fusion is recommended for best Wine compatibility.
- On **openSUSE**, `forceClosewinedbg.sh` (included in the repo) is executed in background to suppress Wine debug windows.
- The Wine prefix is intentionally **separate** from your default `~/.wine` to avoid conflicts.

---

## 🧹 Uninstall

To completely remove Multisim and its Wine prefix:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller will:
- Stop all Wine processes
- Remove the `~/.multisim32` Wine prefix
- Delete desktop launchers and icons
- Optionally remove Wine packages from your system
